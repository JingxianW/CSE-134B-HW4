            <h2>Project 1 - Recipe Website Development</h2>
    
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, easy and fast platform to users to 
                search for the recipe. Our team has 12 people, each person has different responsibility
                in this project. The name of our website called 'Easy Chef'. It includes a meal of the 
                day so users don’t need to search through a large pool of dishes and a simple, easy to use 
                meal planner for users to plan out their week. This application is perfect for those who 
                are new to cooking and are looking for quick dishes to create that taste great.
            </p>
