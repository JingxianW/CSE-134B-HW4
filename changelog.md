# CSE-134-HW3

### First Part
- I changed the fonts to provide better readability.
- I changed the font size for small screen for every wepage in order to provide better readability and avoid zoom in on phone devices. I googled the minimum font size for phone, I set the minimum font size for webpages, when the screen is shrinking, the font size will become smaller until reach the minimum font size. 
- For AboutMe page, I reset the margin for boxes to provide better aesthetics. 
- For small screen, I added hambergur menu in homepage. When you click it, the menu will pop up. When you click it again, the menu will disappear.

### Second Part
- I added the script code for Google Analytics for tracking to aboutMe.html, contactMe.html, crud.html, customdialog.html, lab.html, nativedialogs.html, projects.html, resume.html and styledcrud.html. 
- I chose to include Google Analytics for tracking to my website because I want to know what webpage is most interesting to visitors. I can add more information to those popular web pages. And I can improve the content of less popular webpages.  
- I added the script for Google Analytics for tracking. I think adding this worth 5 points because first, I spent some time to learn what is the 3rd Party Script and to figure out which one is useful for my website. Second, I spent time to learn how to use Google Analytics, I signed up an account and change the properties and settings. After I added my website URL to Google Analytics, I spent some time to figure out where is the script code I need to included in my HTML. After I figured out this, I added the script to all of my HTML files. I think the time I spent on learning this, choosing a useful 3rd Party Script and adding the script to all the HTML files worth 5 points.
